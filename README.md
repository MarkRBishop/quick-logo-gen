# Description

This is an application using inquirer and jest. Using node, you have the ability to create a simple logo in an .svg file.

# Usage

After getting through steps 0 through 2 in the Getting started section, step 3 prompts you with several questions. It asks for 3 letters for the logo, a color for the text, provides a list of shapes you can choose from, and then asks what color you'd like to use for the logo (shape) itself. Afterwards, a logo.svg is created which you can view in a web browser. 

# License

# Tests

There are a few tests to ensure that the application works well. After you've at least ran step 1 from the getting started section, you can run the command below to see the results of the test.

```
npm test
